2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1580#1 Warning
Phase alignment  
Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 u5/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerMaster. This can result in corrupted data. The u5/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerMaster/CLK / u5/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerMaster/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1580#2 Warning
Phase alignment  
Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 u5/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerSlave. This can result in corrupted data. The u5/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerSlave/CLK / u5/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerSlave/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1580#3 Warning
Phase alignment  
Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 u5/U0/DataEncoders[0].DataSerializer/SerializerMaster. This can result in corrupted data. The u5/U0/DataEncoders[0].DataSerializer/SerializerMaster/CLK / u5/U0/DataEncoders[0].DataSerializer/SerializerMaster/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship.
